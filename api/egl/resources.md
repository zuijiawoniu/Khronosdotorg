# EGL Resources

We believe the true usefulness of EGL goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg)!

## Commercial and Open Source Implementations
* [Pablo - Open source Khronos API Implementations](http://pablo.khronos.org/) Pablo is a cross-platform opensource implementation of the Khronos EGL, OpenVG and OpenGL ES APIs. Utilising the underlying OpenGL hardware available on most PCs and Macs, Pablo provides a performant, conformant implentation.
